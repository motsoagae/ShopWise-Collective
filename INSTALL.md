# 🎉 ShopWise Collective - COMPLETE & READY

## ✅ What Was Fixed

Your extension had **10 critical issues** that prevented it from working:

1. **Broken JSON syntax** in manifest.json
2. **No Takealot support** - only Amazon logic existed
3. **Poor price detection** - limited selectors
4. **Dated UI/UX** - basic and unprofessional
5. **No visualization** - just text lists
6. **No error handling** - silent failures
7. **Poor management** - no clear button, no images
8. **Wrong currency** - USD for everything
9. **Limited storage** - only 30 entries
